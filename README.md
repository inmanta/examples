## LSM related examples

LSM means `Lifecycle and Service Management`, which is not part of the opensource orchestrator.

To learn LSM, the first thing to look at is the documentation: [here](https://docs.inmanta.com/inmanta-service-orchestrator/4/moduleguides/lsm/index.html#). For LSM with allocation: [here](https://docs.inmanta.com/inmanta-service-orchestrator/4/moduleguides/lsm/allocation/allocation.html)

This repo has the following additional examples.

1. [Network configuration examples](Networking/README.md): Collection of examples on how to configure different services on vendor devices
2. [lsm-external-allocation](lsm-external-allocation/README.md): example on how to allocate and de-allocate attributes from an external inventory
3. [lsm-from-inventory-a](lsm-from-inventory-a/README.md): example on how to load all attributes of a service from an external inventory
4. [lsm-from-inventory-b](lsm-from-inventory-b/README.md): another example on how to load all attributes of a service from an external inventory
5. [lsm-partial-allocation](lsm-partial-allocation/README.md): shows a use case of the AllocatorWrapper from the lsm module.  This example is relevant for services which need multiple allocations that might fail, and the service needs to know the succeeded allocated values for the de-allocation.  Without the AllocatorWrapper, the successfully allocated values would be lost if a failure in an upcoming allocation on the same service is raised.

## LSM, external inventory, which example is suitable for which inventory?

If you want to fetch the entire service definition from the inventory take a look at [external-allocation](external-allocation/README.md).

If proper de-allocation is important and you use an external inventory, there are some additional things to keep in mind:

* de-allocation when the service is decommissioned
* de-allocation after a failed allocation (we already allocated some attributes, but not all of them)
* resume allocation after a hard failure (e.g. the machine with the orchestrator on it died while allocation was ongoing)

How to handle these depends on the inventory
